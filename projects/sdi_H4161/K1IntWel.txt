Rem	Kaweah No 1 Intake Gage data conversion to Analog Output

Rem This is the basic program version that sends the Shaft encoder data to the H4161
Rem This is a program for sending data from the XL to several H4161 Analog Converters.
Rem Gage 201: An H331 Shaft Encoder (SDI01) senses the river level and sends the data to the H350XL
Rem The data from the 201 H350XL is connected to the gage house at the top of the sandbox by hard-line SDI12 communication.

Rem Gage 201a: An analog 4-20ma signal is sent from the Panametrics DF868 to the H350XL for monitoring the fish release flow
Rem through the release pipe at the sandbox (ana2)
Rem (ana2) is processed through (fnt02) to reduce zero cut off errors. (fnt02) outputs the value for (ana2)

Rem Gage 202: An analog 4-20ma signal is sent from the Panametrics DF868 tot he H350XL for monitoring the canal flow below the fish wheel (ana1)
Rem (ana1) is processed through (fnt01) to reduce zero cut off errors. (fnt01) outputs the value for (ana1)

Rem Air Temp: An H377 temperature probe is located adjacent to the GOES antenna and is connected to the analog input on the H350XL (ana3) output as (fnt03)
Rem H20 Temp: An H377 temperature probe is located inside the infall box below the fish wheel and is connected to the analog input on the H350XL (ana4) output as (fnt04)

Rem This program scales the Canal AVM Flow, Fish release AVM flow, River Gage Height, Air Temp, and H20 Temp into analog output values for H416's              

Rem set variables and measure values

Rem fnt01 is the output from the Panametrics AVM for canal flow gage no. 202 A function
Rem is used to prevent errors at zero flow
Rem the actual input to the H350XL is ana1

b=fnt01

Rem fnt02 is the output from the Panametrics AVM for fish release gage no. 201a A function
Rem is used to prevent errors at zero flow
Rem the actual input to the H500XL at the block house is ana2
measure(fnt02)
c=fnt02

Rem fnt03 is the output from the H377 that measures the outside air temperature
Rem the actual input to the H350XL is ana3

Rem Air Temp to analog output (0-130 deg F)
i=d/130*16+4

Rem Stilling Well Water Temp to analog output (0-100 deg F)
j=e/100*16+4

Rem use extended command to set analog output values 
Rem The sdi12 address of the river (201) H4161 is set to "2"
Rem The sdi12 address of the Canal AVM (202) H4161 is set to "3"
Rem The sdi12 address of the Fish Release AVM (201a) H4161 is set to "4"
Rem The sdi12 address of the Air temp H4161 is set to "5"
Rem The sdi12 address of the Water Tmep H4161 is set to "6"

Rem delays of 100 milliseconds are used to allow adequate time for writing to the SDI12 bus
